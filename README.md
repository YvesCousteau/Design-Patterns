# Design-Patterns
---
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. 
Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.
Pattern description:
- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

Some pattern catalogs list other useful details, such as applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns.

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.
- Most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. Usually apply only to a single programming language.
- Universal and high-level patterns are *architectural patterns*. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

All patterns can be categorized by their *intent*, or purpose. 
Groups of patterns:
- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
